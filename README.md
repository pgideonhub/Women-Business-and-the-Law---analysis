## Overview

The World Bank uses feedback from over 2000 experts in family, labour and criminal law, as well as members of civil society organizations working on gender issues, to construct the ‘Women, Business and the Law’ (WBL) Index. 

This is an independent personal-interest project.

## Objective

To examine the legal status of women worldwide and the changes in status over the past 50 years.

## Data Contents

35 questions are scored (binary: yes or no) across eight indicators for the years 1971 to 2021. These indicators measure explicit gender-based differences in the law. A score is given to each indicator based on the percentage of ‘yes’ answers in each section. The overall score (WBL) is then calculated by taking the average of the indicator scores.
